Nehru was second only to Mahatma Gandhi in leading the Indian nationalist movement in the 1930s and 1940s. Upon India's independence from Britain in 1947, he served as the country's first Prime Minister for 16 years.[3] Nehru championed parliamentary democracy, secularism, science and technology during the 1950s, powerfully influencing India's arc as a modern nation. In international affairs, he is well-known as one of the Founders of the Non-aligned Movement and, concomitantly, for steering India clear of the two blocs of the Cold War. A coveted author, the books he wrote in prison, such as Letters from a Father to His Daughter (1929), An Autobiography (1936) and The Discovery of India (1946), have been read and deliberated upon around the world.</p></span>

                <p id="career" > Jawaharlal Nehru was a central figure in India's struggle for independence and the country’s first Prime Minister. Born on November 14, 1889, in Allahabad, he studied in England at Harrow School, Trinity College, Cambridge, and the Inns of Court School of Law. After returning to India in 1912, Nehru joined the Indian National Congress and was deeply influenced by Mahatma Gandhi, becoming an ardent supporter of Gandhi's non-cooperation movement. Rising quickly through the ranks, he was elected Congress president several times and played a pivotal role in India’s fight against British colonial rule. After India gained independence on August 15, 1947, Nehru became Prime Minister, a position he held until his death in 1964. As Prime Minister, he focused on modernizing India through industrialization, education, and scientific development. He was also a founding leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, advocating for neutrality during the Cold War. His tenure included challenges like the partition of India and the 1962 Sino-Indian War. Nehru’s vision for a secular, democratic, and progressive India has left a lasting impact on the nation's trajectory. He passed away on May 27, 1964, but remains a significant figure in Indian history. Nehru joined the Indian National Congress in 1919 and quickly rose through the ranks.

                <h1 style="text-align: center;">Legacy</h1>
                <p  id="legacy"> Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, left a lasting legacy that profoundly shaped the nation. He established strong democratic institutions, championed secularism, and laid the foundation for a unified, pluralistic India. Nehru's vision of a mixed economy led to significant industrialization and the creation of key infrastructure, although some criticized the pace of agricultural reform and economic growth. Internationally, he positioned India as a leader in the Non-Aligned Movement, advocating for peaceful coexistence during the Cold War. Nehru also prioritized education, science, and technology, founding institutions like the IITs and ISRO, which have become globally recognized. Despite these achievements, his handling of the Kashmir issue and the rise of dynastic politics in his family remain points of controversy. Nehru's contributions to India's political, social, and economic fabric continue to influence the country's trajectory, making his legacy both enduring and complex. Nehru is remembered as a champion of Indian independence and a strong leader.
                He implemented various reforms and policies to modernize India.</p>
